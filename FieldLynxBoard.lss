; Notes:
;  + Empty lines and lines that start with a semicolon are ignored.
;  + Lines that start with two semicolons indicate a section header.
;    They must be one of the following:
;      ;;Initialization
;      ;;TimeRunning
;      ;;TimeStopped
;      ;;TimeGun
;      ;;TimeBreak
;      ;;TimeUpdate
;      ;;Wind
;      ;;TimeOfDay
;      ;;ResultsHeader
;      ;;ResultsTrailer

;      ;;Message
;    Sections may be omitted, appear in any order, and occur more than once.
;  + Format lines must begin with a value indicating which variable
;    they want to access. The special code \00 indicates that no variable
;    is being requested. If a variable is requested it will be inserted where
;    a '%s' printf style format specifier appears. There can only be one '%s'
;    specifier in lines requesting a variable and no other printf format
;    specifiers may appear. Remember, lines requesting a variable are used as
;    a printf format string and therefore must behave as such. Lines not 
;    requesting variables (code \00) can do whatever they want as these 
;    lines are not fed to a printf statement.
;  + Arbitrary 8 bit values are entered as \hh where h is a lowercase hex
;    digit. Note that h must be lowercase.
;  + Format lines can have the following commands embedded in them.
;    Note that only 10 registers (indexed 0-9) are currently implemented.
;     \U\hh   Set the 'U' value to hh. It is reset after the next command.
;     \Ui\hh  Set the 'U' value to register[hh].
;     \X\hh   Set the 'X' value to hh. It is reset after the next command.
;     \Xi\hh  Set the 'X' value to register[hh].
;     \=\hh   register[hh] = {register[U]|X|1}                 (assign)
;     \*\hh   register[hh] = register[hh] * {register[U]|X|1}  (multiply)
;     \/\hh   register[hh] = register[hh] / {register[U]|X|1}  (divide)
;     \#\hh   register[hh] = register[hh] # {register[U]|X|1}  (modulus)
;     \+\hh   register[hh] = register[hh] + {register[U]|X|1}  (add)
;     \-\hh   register[hh] = register[hh] - {register[U]|X|1}  (subtract)
;     \<\hh   register[hh] = register[hh] << {register[U]|X|1} (shift left)
;     \>\hh   register[hh] = register[hh] >> {register[U]|X|1} (shift right)
;     \&\hh   register[hh] = register[hh] & {register[U]|X|1}  (bit and)
;     \|\hh   register[hh] = register[hh] | {register[U]|X|1}  (bit or)
;     \^\hh   register[hh] = register[hh] ^ {register[U]|X|1}  (bit xor)
;     \~\hh   register[hh] = ~register[hh]                     (bit invert)
;     \F\hh   register[hh] = The result of running Function {U|0} on the 
;             next {X|<eol>} characters.
;              \U\00  IDS checksum.
;              \U\01  XOR checksum. register[hh] is used as the seed value.
;              \U\02  ADD checksum. register[hh] is used as the seed value.
;     \O\hh   Output register[hh] as an {X|1} byte value using method {U|0}.
;              \U\00  Binary little-endian (Intel byte order).
;              \U\01  Binary big-endian (Motorola byte order).
;              \U\02  ASCII text right justified space padded.
;              \U\03  ASCII text right justified zero padded.
;              \U\04  ASCII text left justified space padded.
;              \U\05  ASCII text left justified zero padded.
;     \S\hh   Scan the next {X|1} bytes into register[hh] using method {U|0}.
;              \U\00  ASCII text base 10.
;              \U\01  Binary little-endian (Intel byte order).
;              \U\02  Binary big-endian (Motorola byte order).
;     \P\hh   Run Procedure hh on the next {X|<eol>} characters.
;              \P\00  Reverse characters.
;              \P\01  Convert characters to Colorado Time format. Register[1]
;                       is the current character position on entry and the
;                       next character position on exit.
;              \P\02  Convert characters to Daktronics AllSport format.
;     \B\hh   Delete {register[U]|hh} (to beginning of line if zero) characters 
;             before the cursor or until the string contains X characters.
;     \D\hh   Delete {register[U]|hh} (to end of line if zero) characters 
;             at the cursor or until the string contains X characters.
;     \I\hh   Insert {register[U]|hh} spaces at the cursor or until the string
;             contains X characters.
;     \Ic\hh  Insert {register[U]|hh} {X's|spaces} at the cursor.
;     \L\hh   Move the cursor {register[U]|hh} positions to the left (to the 
;             beginning of the line if zero).
;     \R\hh   Move the cursor {register[U]|hh} positions to the right (to the
;             end of the line if zero).
;    Note that numbers 0 thru 9 can be entered directly for single character
;    embedded commands. For example, '\U\04' is the same as '\U4' and 
;    '\=\01' is the same as '\=1'.
;  + Be very careful about whitespace in each format line. Characters other
;    than '%s' specifiers and embedded commands and values will be sent
;    exactly as they appear on the line. This means, for instance, that using
;    tabs to make a line 'look right' in you favorite editor will cause
;    tabs to be sent to the scoreboard instead of the equivalent number of
;    spaces (probably not what you wanted).
;
; The format lines follow.

;;Initialization

; Line codes:

; subsequent lines to only be sent once per second (when the second's 
; digit changes) instead of approximately 10 times per second. Setting
; register[0] to 0 will resume normal operation for remaining lines.
